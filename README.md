# carpal2
Carpal2 project using AT&amp;T IoT Starter Kit

The Pubnub queue watcher to load MongoDB will need your MongoDB account in the mongodbURI (my example has mqtt:password) and your Pubnub subscribeKey. 

The mylocation.html eon-map - just follow the instructions at https://github.com/pubnub/eon-map to setup a mapbox account and map, etc.
